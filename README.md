## Support and contact details

_As of right now there are no known bugs, but if you come accross one, or it is crashing on your device please contact me at jackson.meyer7@gmail.com and give me all the details you can about the crash, location, device model, level of android you are running, ect._

## Technologies Used

_This app is built extensively in the IDE Android Studios; this means that I am writing the bulk of this program in Java, while the UI is styled in mostly in XML.
